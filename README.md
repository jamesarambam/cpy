# cpy
Cpy is a python wrapper built on top of IBM ILOG Cplex Python API. I find the default API somewhat low level, and if you are migrating from Java, then it could be bit difficult initially. Also the code readabilty of the default Python API is not good. The wrapper is very much similar to the Java API.
